# Fairest

## Features
* FastAPI with Python 3.8
* NextJS with Typescript
* Pytest for backend tests
* Jest for frontend tests
* Docker compose for easier development
* Traefik as a reverse proxy to allow backend and frontend on the same port

## Development

The only dependencies for this project should be docker and docker-compose.

### Quick Start

Starting the project with hot-reloading enabled
(the first time it will take a while):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

And navigate to http://localhost:8000

_Note: If you see an Nginx error at first with a `502: Bad Gateway` page, you may have to wait for webpack to build the development server (the nginx container builds much more quickly)._

Auto-generated docs will be at
http://localhost:8000/api/docs

### Rebuilding containers:

```
docker-compose build
```

### Restarting containers:

```
docker-compose restart
```

### Bringing containers down:

```
docker-compose down
```

### Frontend Development

Alternatively to running inside docker, it can sometimes be easier
to use npm directly for quicker reloading. To run using npm:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This should redirect you to http://localhost:3000

### Frontend Tests

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm test
```

## Testing

There is a helper script for both frontend and backend tests:

```
./scripts/test.sh
```

### Backend Tests

```
docker-compose run backend pytest
```

any arguments to pytest can also be passed after this command

### Frontend Tests

```
docker-compose run frontend test
```

This is the same as running npm test from within the frontend directory

## Logging

```
docker-compose logs
```

Or for a specific service:

```
docker-compose logs -f name_of_service # frontend|backend|db
```
