# Fairest frontend

This is a basic website intended to show a minimally functional fairest server. There are several functions that might
go well with fairest to provide a genuine user experience but this one just does this.

* A landing page to receive requests in the following formats:
  * Text from a textarea input on the page
  * A word docx file to be uploaded by the server.

* A results page showing the reports that are generated based on the request, and a button to return to the landing
  page.

* An about page to introduce fairest

* A configuration page to display all the backend information, fairest rules installed and other statistics.

As a reference, you can use this source to implement your own frontend.

## Backend

## What this website runs on.
